# Path Planning

### Requirements
I'm pretty sure it's only `pip install tinyik`
Alternatively, cd to this folder and do `pip install -r requirements.txt` for extra fancy points

### Visualization
Try out `python vis_planner.py` for an interactive point planner projected into 2D space :D (a z coordinate is hardcoded in the code)
